## Introduction

This project aims to try and understand the parameters that affect prices in the Airbnbs in NYC. We are also looking at a possible correlation between the differebt neighbourhoods and the prices per night /  fee prices. 

## Project Goal
The goals of this project is to apply the data preparation knowledge and to train more in  Python, Data Cleaning/ Wrangling and Streamlit.


## Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for this project are as follows:

* We are excpectedto use the Kanban board for this project. 
* Use the provided dataset which is a sample of Kaggle open source Dataset. 
* Examine the dataset for the possible issues
* The dataset need a major cleaning which we did as we got rid of the  missing values and deleting unnecessary columns. 
* We have analyzed our data using matplotlib, and streamlit. 

* We tried to get familiarized with the element of dashboarding on Spyder using Streamlit. We were able to display an interractive map that shows airbnb listings by price. 

## Deliverables


* **CSV file with clean data** containing the results of our data for the visualization.
* **Python file** containing all Python code and commands.
* **A ``README.md`` file** containing a detailed explanation of the process including explanation of the dashboard development
* **
* **Slides** containing all the necessary details and outputs of your project
**** Streamlit code on Spyder
