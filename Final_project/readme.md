DATA FIR BETTER CLIMBING/ 

*Alix NAIT SAIDI*

**Data Analytics bootcamp @IronHack Paris, Jul- Sep 22**/

## Project definition/

This is my final project for the Data Analytics bootcamp I did in July-Sep 2022 at [IronHack](https://www.ironhack.com/fr/data-analytics/paris) in Paris./

Using A survey sent to amateur climbers, it aims at visualising and analysing the correlation there is to observe between different features in a climber (weight, height, gender, training\'85.)  and their performance.\
The completion of this project has taken 4 days before being presented to a jury.\
/
## Business case\
Climbing is becoming more and more popular. Climbing gyms seem to be cropping all over the place, especially in the Parisian Region, so this seems to be a profitable business to the founders (Arkose, Climb up, Blockout, Blockbuster \'85) \
As a climber, I am personnaly interested in getting better in this sport. So I decided to use data to try and understand what make us get better, no matter if we are short, tall, heavy or light. Are there any other features that we can actually monitor that really matter. \
\
\
The answers we aim at providing to these questions should be of interest to:\
\
- Do females have the same chances at flashing an advances level as males \
- Is starting age correlated to the level flashed\
- Does height really matter\
## Plan\
To answer the above questions, we need to:\
\
1. Collect the data using a survey (French and English)\
2. Clean the data.( and translate the French survey into English) \
3. Explore the data to define the relevant metrics, analyses, and projections (EDA): we might need to iterate several times on data cleaning and EDA.\
4. Define the models & algorithms that best describe and explain the correlation between physical attributes and the performance of a climber and his ability to participate in a competition. \
5. Synthetise insights and communicate them to the public. \
